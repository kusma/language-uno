# Uno language support in Atom

Adds syntax highlighting and snippets to Uno files in Atom.

Based on the [Atom C# package](https://github.com/atom/language-csharp).

Originally [converted](http://atom.io/docs/latest/converting-a-text-mate-bundle)
from the [C# TextMate bundle](https://github.com/wintermi/csharp-tmbundle).

Contributions are greatly appreciated. Please fork this repository and open a
pull request to add snippets, make grammar tweaks, etc.
